# Step-Detection
A step detection algorithm that analyses walking data from a smartphone accelerometer app. It estimates the step count from the raw time-series signals under three circumstances: (1) Phone in hand. (2) Phone in pocket (3) Phone in bag. 

Frequency filtering was performed using a low-pass filter to eliminate noise. The impact of an adaptive threshold on the accuracy of the algorithm was explored as well
